# Garamond Libre
## Description
Garamond Libre is a free and open-source old-style font family. It is a &quot;true Garamond,&quot;
i.e., it is based off the designs of 16th-century French engraver Claude Garamond (also
spelled Garamont). The Roman design is Garamondâ€™s; the italics are from a design by
Robert Granjon. The upright Greek font is after a design by Firmin Didot; the &quot;italic&quot;
Greek font is after a design by Alexander Wilson. The font family includes support for
Latin, Greek (monotonic and polytonic) and Cyrillic scripts, as well as small capitals,
old-style figures, superior and inferior figures, historical ligatures, Byzantine musical
symbols, the IPA and swash capitals. The fonts are an extended fork based on designs by
George Douros.
